## US Bikeshare Data Analysis Project
### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States are analyzed:
* Chicago
* New York City
* Washington

### Files used
Python script:
* **bikeshare.py**

Dataset files:
* **chicago.csv**
* **new_york_city.csv**
* **washington.csv**

All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

* Gender
* Birth Year

The dataset was not provided in git repository because of the size of the files. Please contact with Udacity (https://udacity.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you want to use these dataset.
