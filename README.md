## US Bikeshare Data Analysis Project
### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States are analyzed:
*Chicago*
*New York City*
*Washington*

### Files used
Python script:

**bikeshare.py**

Dataset files:

**chicago.csv**
**new_york_city.csv**
**washington.csv**

The dataset was not provided in git repository because of the size of the files. Please contact with Udacity (https://udacity.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) if you want to use these dataset.

### Credits
This project is prepared by Udacity, as a project of **Programming for Data Science Nanodegree** for the people interested in data science.
Data provided by **Motivate**, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States.
